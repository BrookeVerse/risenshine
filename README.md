## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Using react, I created a web page that is using various APIs. Firebase is used as a Auth to create accounts, as well as a database for affirmations that can CRUD. It uses the TOM TOM api to create a map and allow you to plan a route for the days travels, and the Weather Api using your local location to show the weather happening.
